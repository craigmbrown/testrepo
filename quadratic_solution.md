# Quadratic Equation Solution

## Problem
Solve the following quadratic equation for all values of x in simplest form:

```
(x+10)² - 14 = 11
```

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Isolate the squared term
Add 14 to both sides:
```
(x+10)² = 11 + 14
(x+10)² = 25
```

### Step 2: Take the square root of both sides
```
x + 10 = ±√25
x + 10 = ±5
```

### Step 3: Solve for x
Subtract 10 from both sides:
```
x = -10 ± 5
```

### Step 4: Find both solutions
```
x = -10 + 5 = -5
x = -10 - 5 = -15
```

## Final Answer

**x = -5  or  x = -15**

## Verification

### For x = -5:
```
(-5 + 10)² - 14 = 11
(5)² - 14 = 11
25 - 14 = 11
11 = 11 ✓
```

### For x = -15:
```
(-15 + 10)² - 14 = 11
(-5)² - 14 = 11
25 - 14 = 11
11 = 11 ✓
```

Both solutions are correct!
