# Quadratic Equation Solution

## Problem
Solve for all values of x in simplest form:
```
13 + 3x² = 16
```

## Solution

**Step 1:** Subtract 13 from both sides
```
3x² = 16 - 13
3x² = 3
```

**Step 2:** Divide both sides by 3
```
x² = 1
```

**Step 3:** Take the square root of both sides
```
x = ±√1
x = ±1
```

## Answer
**x = 1** or **x = -1**

### Verification
- When x = 1: 13 + 3(1)² = 13 + 3 = 16 ✓
- When x = -1: 13 + 3(-1)² = 13 + 3 = 16 ✓
