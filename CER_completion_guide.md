# Step-by-Step Guide to Completing Your Thailand CER

## Important Reminder: Use the ERC Approach!

While we call it "CER," you should actually work in **ERC** order:
1. **Evidence** - Collect ALL data first
2. **Reasoning** - Analyze what the data tells you
3. **Claim** - Make your determination based on evidence

**Avoid confirmation bias!** Don't cherry-pick data to support a pre-determined claim.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Your Evidence ✓
**File to use:** `thailand_demographic_data.md`

1. Access the U.S. Census International Data Base
2. Search for Thailand demographic data
3. Record ALL numerical data in the data collection file:
   - Birth rates and death rates
   - Population growth rates
   - Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
   - Age structure percentages
   - Any other relevant indicators

**Don't skip this step!** Having specific numbers is crucial for a strong CER.

### Step 2: Analyze Your Evidence ✓
**File to use:** `thailand_demographic_transition_CER.md`

For each piece of evidence, complete the three-part structure:

**A. Define the Evidence**
- What is this type of demographic indicator?
- Why is it useful for understanding demographic transition?

**B. Describe the Evidence**
- What are the specific numbers?
- What patterns do you observe?
- **Be specific!** Use actual numerical data, not vague descriptions

**C. Connect to Reasoning**
- How does this evidence point to a specific phase?
- Compare your numbers to the phase characteristics
- Consider whether the data shows transitional features

---

### Step 3: Determine Your Claim ✓

**After completing all evidence analysis**, look at the overall picture:

**Questions to consider:**
- Do all three pieces of evidence point to the same phase?
- Are there contradictions that suggest transition between phases?
- Which phase characteristics best match Thailand's data?

**Be honest about transitional status!**
- If Thailand shows late Phase II/early Phase III characteristics, say so!
- The boundaries between phases aren't rigid
- It's okay to say "transitioning from ___ to ___"

---

### Step 4: Write Your Opening Paragraph ✓

Go back to the top of your CER and complete the opening:
- Define demographic transition theory
- State your claim clearly
- Example: "According to data from the U.S. Census International Data Base, Thailand is in late Phase II/early Phase III of demographic transition, showing characteristics of industrialization with declining birth rates."

---

### Step 5: Write Your Closing Paragraph ✓

Wrap up your analysis:
- Restate your claim
- Briefly summarize the three key pieces of evidence
- Acknowledge any nuances or transitional features

---

## Self-Check Questions

Before considering your CER complete, ask yourself:

- [ ] Have I included specific numerical data in each evidence paragraph?
- [ ] Did I define each type of evidence clearly?
- [ ] Did I explain the reasoning connecting evidence to my claim?
- [ ] Is my claim supported by ALL the evidence, not just selected pieces?
- [ ] Did I consider the evidence objectively before making my claim?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged any transitional characteristics?

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Making the claim first, then finding evidence** - This leads to confirmation bias!
2. **Vague descriptions** - "The birth rate is low" vs. "The birth rate is 10.9 per 1,000"
3. **Ignoring contradictory evidence** - If data points to different phases, acknowledge it!
4. **Weak reasoning** - Don't just state evidence; explain WHY it supports your claim
5. **No numerical data** - Each evidence paragraph needs specific numbers

---

## Example of Strong vs. Weak Evidence Paragraph

### Weak Example:
"Thailand has a low birth rate and death rate. This shows it is in Phase III."

### Strong Example:
"Thailand's birth rate is 10.9 per 1,000 population and its death rate is 8.3 per 1,000 population (U.S. Census IDB, 2023). This results in a natural increase rate of 2.6 per 1,000, or 0.26% annual growth. These rates are significantly lower than Phase II nations, which typically show birth rates of 30-40 per 1,000. The narrow gap between birth and death rates indicates that Thailand has progressed beyond the rapid expansion phase and is approaching population stability, a hallmark of Phase III demographic transition."

Notice the difference:
- Specific numbers included
- Source and year cited
- Comparison to phase characteristics
- Clear reasoning linking evidence to claim
