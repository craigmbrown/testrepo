# Quadratic Equation Solution 4

## Problem
Solve the following quadratic equation for all values of x in simplest form:

```
2(x+4)² + 44 = 46
```

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Subtract 44 from both sides
```
2(x+4)² = 46 - 44
2(x+4)² = 2
```

### Step 2: Divide both sides by 2
```
(x+4)² = 2/2
(x+4)² = 1
```

### Step 3: Take the square root of both sides
```
x + 4 = ±√1
x + 4 = ±1
```

### Step 4: Solve for x
Subtract 4 from both sides:
```
x = -4 ± 1
```

### Step 5: Find both solutions
```
x = -4 + 1 = -3
x = -4 - 1 = -5
```

## Final Answer

**x = -3  or  x = -5**

## Verification

### For x = -3:
```
2(-3 + 4)² + 44 = 46
2(1)² + 44 = 46
2(1) + 44 = 46
2 + 44 = 46
46 = 46 ✓
```

### For x = -5:
```
2(-5 + 4)² + 44 = 46
2(-1)² + 44 = 46
2(1) + 44 = 46
2 + 44 = 46
46 = 46 ✓
```

Both solutions are correct!
