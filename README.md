# Thailand Demographic Transition Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of Thailand's position in the Demographic Transition Model using data from the U.S. Census International Data Base and other demographic sources.

## Description

This repository contains a formal CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) analysis determining Thailand's demographic stage based on empirical evidence including birth rates, death rates, fertility rates, population growth, and age structure data.

## Key Findings

**Claim:** Thailand is in late Phase III of demographic transition, transitioning toward Phase IV.

**Supporting Evidence:**
1. **Birth/Death Rates:** 9.4 per 1,000 (birth) vs 8.7 per 1,000 (death) - negative natural increase in 2024
2. **Age Structure:** Average age 40.9 years, constrictive population pyramid, aging population
3. **Fertility:** TFR of 1.0-1.45 children per woman (well below 2.1 replacement level)

## Methodology

This analysis follows the ERC (Evidence-Reasoning-Claim) framework, examining all available data objectively before determining the demographic classification.
