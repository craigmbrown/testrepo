# Demographic Transition Analysis: Thailand

## Country Overview
**Country:** Thailand
**Analysis Date:** October 2025
**Region:** Southeast Asia

---

## 1. Population Data

### Current Population Size
- **UN Estimate (2025):** 71,619,863
- **Thai Government Data (Jan 2025):** 65,951,210
  - Thai nationals: 64,953,661
  - Non-Thai residents: 997,549
- **Population Rank:** 20th globally

### Population Trend: **DECLINING** ⚠️

**Key Findings:**
- Thailand's population declined by 100,000 in 2024
- First time births fell below 500,000 since 1949
- Historic demographic shift from growth to decline
- Projections suggest population could shrink to 40 million within 50 years

**What this tells us:** Thailand has entered a phase of population decline, indicating it is in **late Stage 4 or Stage 5** of demographic transition.

## 2. Annual Growth Rate

### 2025 Growth Rate: **-0.07% to +0.3%**

**Historical Context:**
- 2024: 0.26% increase from 2023
- 2025: Projected -0.07% (UN data) or slight positive growth
- 20-year average: 0.42% per year
- **Trend:** Declining toward negative growth

**Data Source Links:**
- Worldometer: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/thailand-population/
- World Population Review: https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/thailand

**What this tells us:** Near-zero or negative growth rate confirms Thailand is experiencing demographic decline typical of advanced demographic transition stages.

## 3. Age Structure Diagram Analysis

### How to Access:
1. **PopulationPyramid.net:** https://www.populationpyramid.net/thailand/2025/
2. **CIA World Factbook:** https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/thailand/
3. **UN Population Division:** https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Pyramid/764

### Expected Characteristics:
Based on Thailand's demographic data, the age structure should show:
- **Narrow base:** Very few young children (low birth rates)
- **Bulge in middle ages:** Large working-age population (30-50 years)
- **Expanding top:** Growing elderly population (60+ years)
- **Shape:** "Inverted pyramid" or "coffin shape" typical of aging societies

### Age Structure Implications:
- **Dependency Ratio:** Increasing as elderly population grows
- **Working Age Population:** Currently large but will shrink
- **Youth Population:** Declining dramatically

## 4. Total Fertility Rate (TFR)

### Current TFR: **1.0 births per woman** (2024-2025)

**Historical Comparison:**
- 2023: 1.212 births per woman
- 2022: 1.32 births per woman
- **Trend:** Rapidly declining

### Critical Context:
- **Replacement Level:** 2.1 births per woman needed for stable population
- **Thailand's TFR:** 1.0 (53% below replacement level)
- **Comparison:** Lower than Japan (1.2), similar to South Korea
- **Regional Context:** Only Southeast Asian country with declining birth rates per UN classification

**Data Sources:**
- Thai Government Report (Jan 2025): https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/01/17/thailands-population-drops-below-66-million-as-births-hit-75-year-low/
- Macrotrends: https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/tha/thailand/fertility-rate

**What this tells us:** Ultra-low fertility rate indicates Thailand is firmly in late-stage demographic transition with serious implications for future population decline and aging.

## 5. Life Expectancy at Birth by Sex

### Current Life Expectancy (2024-2025 estimates):

| Category | Years | Data Year |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Overall (Both Sexes)** | 77.9 years | 2024 |
| **Females** | 83.9 years | 2022 |
| **Males** | ~72-74 years* | 2022 (est.) |
| **Gender Gap** | ~10-12 years | - |

*Male life expectancy estimated based on overall average and female data

### Historical Trend:
- Life expectancy has been **increasing** over past decades
- Reflects improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living standards
- High life expectancy contributes to population aging

**Data Sources:**
- Worldometer: https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/thailand-demographics/
- Statista: https://www.statista.com/statistics/974709/life-expectancy-at-birth-in-thailand-by-gender/

**What this tells us:** High and rising life expectancy, combined with low fertility, creates rapid population aging - a hallmark of advanced demographic transition.

## 6. Demographic Transition Stage Assessment

### **Stage: Late Stage 4 / Early Stage 5**

### Stage Characteristics:

#### Stage 4 (Post-Transitional):
- ✅ Low birth rates
- ✅ Low death rates
- ✅ High life expectancy
- ✅ Stable or slowly declining population
- ✅ Aging population structure

#### Stage 5 (Declining):
- ✅ **Very low fertility (below replacement)**
- ✅ **Population decline**
- ✅ **Rapidly aging society**
- ✅ **Inverted age pyramid**
- ✅ **Shrinking workforce**

### Evidence Summary:

| Indicator | Value | Stage Indication |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| TFR | 1.0 | Stage 5 (Ultra-low) |
| Growth Rate | -0.07% to 0.3% | Stage 4-5 (Decline/Stable) |
| Population Trend | Declining | Stage 5 |
| Life Expectancy | 77.9 years | Stage 4-5 (High) |
| Age Structure | Inverted pyramid | Stage 5 |

### Demographic Challenges:

1. **Rapid Aging:**
   - Growing elderly population (65+)
   - Shrinking working-age population
   - Increasing dependency ratios

2. **Population Decline:**
   - 100,000 decrease in 2024
   - Births below 500,000 annually
   - Could halve in 60 years

3. **Economic Implications:**
   - Labor force shrinkage
   - Increased healthcare and pension costs
   - Reduced economic growth potential

4. **Social Implications:**
   - Need for elderly care infrastructure
   - Immigration pressures to maintain workforce
   - Changes to social security systems

### Regional Context:
Thailand is the **only Southeast Asian country** experiencing this demographic pattern, placing it ahead of neighbors like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Philippines in the demographic transition.

### Comparison with Other Countries:
- Similar to: **Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, Germany**
- More advanced than: **Most Southeast Asian nations**
- Less extreme than: **South Korea (TFR 0.7)**

## 7. Summary and Conclusions

### Key Findings:

1. **Thailand has entered demographic decline** with negative or near-zero population growth
2. **Ultra-low fertility rate (1.0)** far below replacement level
3. **Rapidly aging population** with high life expectancy (77.9 years)
4. **First country in Southeast Asia** to experience this demographic pattern
5. **Historic shift:** Population decreased by 100,000 in 2024

### Demographic Transition Stage: **Stage 5 (Declining Population)**

Thailand has completed the demographic transition and entered a new phase characterized by:
- Population decline
- Ultra-low fertility
- Rapid population aging
- Inverted age pyramid
- Shrinking youth population

### Future Outlook:
Without policy interventions or significant immigration, Thailand's population will continue to:
- Decline in total numbers
- Age rapidly
- Face economic and social challenges related to demographic change

### Policy Considerations:
- Pro-natalist policies to encourage births
- Immigration policies to supplement workforce
- Elder care infrastructure development
- Pension and healthcare system reforms
- Economic restructuring for smaller, older population
