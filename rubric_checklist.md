# CER Rubric Checklist for Tier III (Excellent) Work

Use this checklist to ensure your Thailand demographic transition CER meets the highest standards (Tier III/A level).

---

## Introduction Section (10-9 points)

### Content Requirements:
- [ ] **Excellent description of demographic transition theory** - Explain what it is, why it matters, how nations progress through phases
- [ ] **Strong background knowledge** - Reader should understand the context before seeing your claim
- [ ] **Definitive claim** - Single, clear statement that completely answers: "Which phase is Thailand in?"
- [ ] **Engaging and cohesive** - Well-written, flows naturally, draws reader in

### Example Structure:
1. Define demographic transition theory (2-3 sentences)
2. Briefly describe the four phases (2-3 sentences)
3. State your specific claim about Thailand (1 sentence)

**Claim Formula:** "According to data from the U.S. Census International Data Base, Thailand is in [specific phase OR transitioning from Phase X to Phase Y] of demographic transition."

## Supporting Paragraphs (30-27 points total, 10-9 points each)

### Evidence Paragraph #1 Requirements:
- [ ] **Define the evidence type** - Explain what birth/death rates are and why they matter
- [ ] **Specific and numerical data** - Include exact numbers with units (per 1,000 population)
- [ ] **Contextualize the data:**
  - [ ] Compare to phase characteristics (e.g., "typical Phase II nations have birth rates of 30-40 per 1,000")
  - [ ] Establish patterns/trends (e.g., "declining over the past 20 years")
  - [ ] Compare to other values (e.g., "gap between birth and death rates")
- [ ] **Single focus** - This paragraph is ONLY about birth/death rates
- [ ] **Direct, explicit link to claim** - Clearly explain HOW this evidence supports your phase classification
- [ ] **Engaging and cohesive** - Well-written, logical flow

### Evidence Paragraph #2 Requirements:
(Same checklist as above, but focused on your second piece of evidence - e.g., age structure/population pyramid)
- [ ] Define the evidence type
- [ ] Specific and numerical data
- [ ] Contextualize the data
- [ ] Single focus
- [ ] Direct, explicit link to claim
- [ ] Engaging and cohesive

### Evidence Paragraph #3 Requirements:
(Same checklist as above, but focused on your third piece of evidence - e.g., fertility rates/population growth)
- [ ] Define the evidence type
- [ ] Specific and numerical data
- [ ] Contextualize the data
- [ ] Single focus
- [ ] Direct, explicit link to claim
- [ ] Engaging and cohesive

## Conclusion Section (10-9 points)

### Content Requirements:
- [ ] **Reiterate the claim effectively** - Restate your classification (don't just copy/paste, rephrase it)
- [ ] **Briefly summarize specific supporting data** - Mention the key numerical findings from all three evidence types
- [ ] **Brief summary of argument** - How does all the evidence work together to support your claim?
- [ ] **Engaging and cohesive** - Strong ending that wraps up the analysis

### Example Structure:
1. Restate your claim using different wording (1 sentence)
2. Summarize key findings from Evidence #1, #2, and #3 (2-3 sentences with specific numbers)
3. Final synthesizing statement about overall demographic trajectory (1 sentence)

---

## Additional Requirements

### Proofreading (-10% if not done):
- [ ] Check for spelling errors
- [ ] Check for grammar errors
- [ ] Check for punctuation errors
- [ ] Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- [ ] Verify all numbers are accurate

### Originality (−10% for flagged passages):
- [ ] All writing is in your own words
- [ ] Any quotes are properly cited (though CERs typically don't use direct quotes)
- [ ] You've synthesized information rather than copying descriptions
- [ ] If using specific definitions, paraphrase them

---

## Quick Quality Checks

### The "Number Test":
Count how many specific numerical values appear in your CER. You should have:
- At least 3-4 numbers in Evidence Paragraph #1
- At least 3-4 numbers in Evidence Paragraph #2
- At least 3-4 numbers in Evidence Paragraph #3
- **Total: 9-12+ specific numerical data points**

### The "So What?" Test:
For each evidence paragraph, ask: "So what? How does this specific data point to my phase classification?"
If you can't answer this clearly, strengthen your reasoning.

### The "Stranger Test":
Could someone who knows nothing about demographic transition read your introduction and understand:
- What demographic transition is?
- What the different phases represent?
- What your specific claim is?

### The "Explicit Connection Test":
Do you use phrases that directly connect evidence to claim? Look for:
- "This supports the claim that Thailand is in Phase ___ because..."
- "These rates indicate..."
- "This characteristic is typical of Phase ___ nations..."
- "This evidence demonstrates..."

## Tier III vs. Tier II: What's the Difference?

### Tier II (Satisfactory) might say:
"Thailand has a birth rate of 10.9 per 1,000. This is low."

### Tier III (Excellent) says:
"Thailand's birth rate of 10.9 per 1,000 population represents a dramatic decline from the 30+ per 1,000 rates typical of Phase II nations. This low birth rate, approaching the 8-15 per 1,000 range characteristic of Phase IV societies, indicates that Thailand has progressed well beyond the transitional phase and is experiencing the fertility decline associated with increased education and economic development."

**Notice the Tier III version:**
- Provides context through comparison
- Explains the significance of the number
- Links directly to phase characteristics
- Connects to underlying causes (education, economic development)
- Uses more sophisticated, precise language

## Before You Submit:

- [ ] I have completed ALL sections of the CER template
- [ ] Each evidence paragraph has 3+ specific numerical values
- [ ] I have defined all major vocabulary/evidence types
- [ ] I have directly connected each piece of evidence to my claim
- [ ] My claim is consistent throughout (intro, body, conclusion)
- [ ] I have proofread carefully
- [ ] I have checked originality
- [ ] My writing is engaging and flows well
- [ ] Someone else could understand my argument by reading this

**Remember:** The difference between Tier II and Tier III is often in the details - specific numbers, contextualization, and explicit reasoning. Don't settle for "good enough" when you can achieve excellence with thorough data analysis and clear explanations!
