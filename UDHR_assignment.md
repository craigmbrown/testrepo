### Which countries did not vote "yes"? Why might they have been hesitant?

**Voting Results:**
- **48 countries** voted in favor
- **0 countries** voted against
- **8 countries** abstained: Soviet Union, Byelorussia (Belarus), Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa
- **2 countries** did not vote: Honduras and Yemen

**Example Analysis - Why They Abstained:**

**Soviet Union and Soviet Bloc countries (USSR, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia):**
[YOUR ANALYSIS HERE: Consider the Soviet view that the UDHR didn't apply to communist societies where they claimed "the State and the individual were in harmony." Think about individual rights vs. collective rights, property rights, freedom of movement, etc.]

**Saudi Arabia:**
[YOUR ANALYSIS HERE: Saudi Arabia objected primarily to Article 18 (right to change religion) and Article 16 (equal marriage rights). Why might these conflict with Islamic law as interpreted by Saudi Arabia at the time?]

**South Africa:**
[YOUR ANALYSIS HERE: Consider South Africa's apartheid system in 1948. Which rights in the UDHR would directly conflict with racial segregation and discrimination?]

## Part 5: Articles 29 & 30 as "Disclaimer"

**Article 29:**
"Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible. In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others..."

**Article 30:**
"Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein."

**How do these serve as a "disclaimer"?**

[YOUR EXPLANATION HERE: Consider:
- Article 29: How does it limit rights? Why? (balancing individual rights with community needs)
- Article 30: What does it prevent? (using rights to destroy other rights)
- Examples: Can't use "freedom of speech" to incite violence; can't claim "religious freedom" to violate others' rights
- How do these protect the integrity of all other articles?]
