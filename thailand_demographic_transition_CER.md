# Thailand Demographic Transition Analysis - CER

## Opening Paragraph

The Theory of Demographic Transition describes how nations progress through distinct phases as they develop economically and socially. This model tracks changes in birth rates, death rates, and population growth across four main phases. Phase I represents pre-industrial nations with high birth and death rates. Phase II nations are transitioning, with declining death rates but sustained high birth rates, leading to rapid population expansion. Phase III nations are industrialized with declining birth rates as education improves, particularly for women, resulting in stable population sizes. Phase IV represents post-industrial nations experiencing population decline as death rates rise with aging populations.

**CLAIM:** [To be determined after examining all evidence]
According to data from the U.S. Census International Data Base, Thailand is in _____ of demographic transition.

## Evidence Collection (Complete BEFORE making final claim)

### Evidence #1: [Type of Evidence - e.g., Birth and Death Rates]

**Define the Evidence:**
[Explain what birth rate and death rate mean as demographic indicators]

**Describe the Evidence (Include Numerical Data):**
- Birth rate: [Insert numerical data per 1,000 population]
- Death rate: [Insert numerical data per 1,000 population]
- Rate of natural increase: [Calculate: birth rate - death rate]
- Time period: [Specify years of data]

**Connect to Claim (Reasoning):**
[Explain how these rates support classification into a specific phase. Consider: Are rates both high? Is death rate declining while birth rate remains high? Are both declining? Is population shrinking?]

---

### Evidence #2: [Type of Evidence - e.g., Age Structure Diagram/Population Pyramid]

**Define the Evidence:**
[Explain what an age structure diagram represents and what different shapes indicate about population dynamics]

**Describe the Evidence (Include Numerical Data):**
- Shape description: [Wide base/narrow top, column-shaped, inverted pyramid, etc.]
- Percentage of population aged 0-14: [%]
- Percentage of population aged 15-64: [%]
- Percentage of population aged 65+: [%]
- Dependency ratio: [Calculate if data available]

**Connect to Claim (Reasoning):**
[Explain how this age structure supports classification into a specific phase. What does the shape tell us about past birth rates and current demographic trends?]

---

### Evidence #3: [Type of Evidence - e.g., Total Fertility Rate / Population Growth Rate]

**Define the Evidence:**
[Explain what total fertility rate (TFR) or population growth rate measures]

**Describe the Evidence (Include Numerical Data):**
- Total Fertility Rate: [Average number of children per woman]
- Annual population growth rate: [% per year]
- Replacement level comparison: [Is TFR above or below 2.1?]
- Historical trend: [Is this increasing, stable, or decreasing?]

**Connect to Claim (Reasoning):**
[Explain how fertility rates and population growth trends support classification into a specific phase]

## Analysis Notes (ERC Framework - Complete Evidence First!)

**Step 1: Examine ALL Evidence Above**
- What patterns emerge from birth/death rates?
- What does the age structure reveal?
- What do fertility and growth rates indicate?

**Step 2: Develop Reasoning**
- Which phase characteristics best match the evidence?
- Are there indicators of transition between phases?
- What is the overall demographic trajectory?

**Step 3: Make Your Claim**
Based on comprehensive analysis of all evidence, Thailand appears to be in Phase _____ of demographic transition, or transitioning from Phase _____ to Phase _____.

## Closing Paragraph

[Restate your claim and briefly summarize the three main pieces of evidence that support this classification. Acknowledge any transitional characteristics if the nation shows features of multiple phases.]

In conclusion, based on analysis of [Evidence 1], [Evidence 2], and [Evidence 3], Thailand is best classified as being in [Phase] of demographic transition. This classification is supported by [brief summary of key numerical trends]. [Any acknowledgment of transitional status or nuances in the data].
